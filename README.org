* RCAS web interface

This is a simple web interface for RCAS.  A user may upload a BED
file, configure options for RCAS, and then schedule RCAS to be run on
the file.

Separate worker processes pick up the jobs and run them.  Once they
are done the user is provided with a link to the generated RCAS
report.

** Preparing the environment

The easiest way to set up the RCAS web interface is to use GNU Guix.
We need the Redis server to be running and we need to be in an
environment in which RCAS itself is available.

You can achieve this by running the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
guix environment --ad-hoc redis r r-rcas
#+END_SRC

Inside of this environment we create an environment needed to build
and use the web interface.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/dev/RCAS-tools
guix environment --load=guix.scm
#+END_SRC

** Building RCAS web

Now we’re ready to build the web interface.  RCAS web uses the common
GNU build system.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd rcas-web
autoreconf -vif
./configure --prefix=/srv/rcas-web
make
#+END_SRC

At this point you can already use RCAS web—without installing it—by
using the “pre-inst-env” script, e.g. to start the web server:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./pre-inst-env scripts/rcas-web --config=rcas.conf server
#+END_SRC

Note that when using =pre-inst-env= outside of the “rcas-web”
directory you will need to configure the “assets-dir” by modifying the
example configuration file.

** Installing RCAS web

Alternatively, you can install RCAS web by running =make install= as root.

To start the application web server and the worker process(es) do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
${prefix}/bin/rcas-web --config=rcas.conf server &
${prefix}/bin/rcas-web --config=rcas.conf worker &
#+END_SRC

You can and should run a larger number of worker processes.
Currently, one worker process runs exactly one job at a time.

** Configuring RCAS web

RCAS web comes with crude defaults that you probably want to change.
The defaults are recorded in the =%config= value in the file
=rcas/config.scm=.  You can override individual values or all of them
by putting an association list (i.e. a list of key-value pairs)
expression in a file and pointing =rcas-web= to the file with the
=--config= option.

Here’s an example for a configuration file:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
((assets-dir  . "/path/to/web/assets")
 (upload-dir  . "/path/to/file/uploads")
 (results-dir . "/where/to/store/reports")
 (host        . "localhost")
 (port        . 12345))
#+END_SRC

Assuming that this is stored as a file called =rcas.conf= you can make
=rcas-web= use it like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rcas-web --config=rcas.conf [command]
#+END_SRC

An example configuration file =rcas.conf.example= is also created by
the configure script.

The only configuration keys that you will probably need to override
are “upload-dir” (for the directory where RCAS web will store uploaded
BED files) and “results-dir” where RCAS web will store generated
reports.

The “port” key in the configuration file only overrides the *default*
port on which the application web server will listen for HTTP
requests.  Since you will probably want to start multiple web servers
behind a reverse proxy like Nginx overriding the default is not very
useful.  Instead you should pass an additional numeric argument to the
“server” sub-command to set the port.  The following shell command
will start ten web server instances on the ports 3001 to 3010
(inclusive), redirect all output to separate log files, and record the
pid of each web server process:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for port in $(seq 3001 3010); do
  rcas-web --config=rcas.conf server ${port} > rcas-web-${port}.log &
  echo $! > rcas-web-${port}.pid
done
#+END_SRC
